Let's practice fitting linear models!  

This app lets you work with the [Yacht Hydrodynamics data set](https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/243) from the UCI machine learning repository.  

The user can visually check the relationships between the response and the inputs. Then, the user can try out 3 linear models by typing in formulas. The user can then assess the model performance several ways, as well as compare the models by examining their predictive trends.  

The Yacht data set is an example **regression** application with 8 numeric inputs.  

An overview table describing the 8 numeric inputs and numeric response is given below. As you can see, some of the numeric variables have relatively few unique values!
