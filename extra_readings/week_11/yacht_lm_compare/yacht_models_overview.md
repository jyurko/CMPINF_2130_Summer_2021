Now that we have explored the data, it's time to fit models!  

We will fit and compare 3 models. We will look at their coefficients, examine the residuals, visualize training set performance, and evaluate model performance several ways. We will also compare model behavior by visualizing the predictive trends.  

The models are fit in the `"Fit"` tab. You must specify each model by typing in the formula using the **formula interface**. Once you are satisfied with your three models, press the **Fit Now!** button.
